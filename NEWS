Devel version (1.1)
+ Use numerically stable algorithms for sum, mean, and variance
+ Implement dedicated function for rowSums2, rowMeans2, rowVars
 which avoid transposing the input matrix to call the colXXX version
+ Support logical input (lgCMatrix) for all methods that matrixStats
 supports. Introduce new class xgCMatrix as union class of dgCMatrix
 and lgCMatrix.
+ Fix bugs in colTabulates
